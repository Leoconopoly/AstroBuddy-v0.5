It's huge, made up of gases like hydrogen and helium, and it's super hot! Even though it's far away - about 93 million miles from Earth - it still gives us light and warmth, which are really important for life on our planet. Did you know that the Sun is so big that you could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside it? That's mind-blowing!"
